The BigFile blockchain networkâ€™s node software, known as bigfile, is fully open-source, developed as a fork of the Arweave. The BigFile repository emphasizes community-driven development, welcoming public contributions to enhance its features and capabilities. This approach underscores BigFile's commitment to transparency and collaboration in building decentralized infrastructure.
