As we launch the BigFile Beta Testnet, we want to emphasize that this is a true 'beta' release: expect bugs, issues, and network resets as we progress toward the mainnet launch. The software will undergo continuous iteration until we achieve a stable and reliable network. We eagerly welcome bug reports, feedback, and suggestions from the community to help us improve!
