BigFile will be released in two stages to facilitate a seamless Testnet process. Following the Beta Testnet, a standard Testnet version will be launched. As we progress towards the Mainnet release, bugs, issues, and network resets may arise. The software will undergo continuous improvements and iterations to ensure a stable and reliable network. We eagerly welcome bug reports, feedback, and suggestions from the community to enhance and refine the platform!
