When an SNS is launched, it goes through a decentralization swap. During the swap, participants provide BigFile and in return receive a share of the SNS DAO’s governance power in the form of SNS neurons. In the current design swaps are open for anyone to participate.

Different projects in the community have requested a feature that allows SNSs to restrict participation in the swap by geographic location. In addition, this feature enables swap participants to be presented with a custom confirmation text that they need to confirm before being allowed to participate.
